## 🏙️ 1. Background & Motivation

Around the world, governments are increasingly adopting **Machine Learning (ML)** to support sustainable urban development.  
The complexity of modern cities—rapid urbanization, rising CO₂ levels, traffic congestion, and shrinking green spaces—has made traditional planning approaches insufficient.

Predictive analytics now helps policymakers:

- Identify environmental risks earlier  
- Optimize resource allocation  
- Improve public services  
- Design smarter, greener, more livable cities

## 🇬🇨 2. GCC Context: Why This Project Matters

The **GCC Sustainability Innovation Lab (GCC-SIL)** was established under **Oman Vision 2040** to explore how emerging technologies—especially AI—can strengthen sustainability, climate resilience, and urban well-being across GCC nations.

A key focus area is developing advanced analytical tools that help evaluate and compare the sustainability performance of districts and regions.

To achieve this, GCC-SIL requires a system capable of:

- Integrating environmental, social, and infrastructure data  
- Identifying patterns and correlations  
- Predicting sustainability outcomes  
- Providing actionable insights for policymakers  

This is where the **District Sustainability Index (DSI)** model comes in.

## 🎯 3. Project Objective

The main objective is to build a **complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** that can:

- Analyze sustainability indicators  
- Identify hidden patterns  
- Predict a continuous DSI score (0–100)  
- Provide visual insights for decision-makers  
- Maintain interpretability and low overfitting  

The final model supports urban authorities in identifying high-risk districts that require intervention or green infrastructure investment.

## 📊 4. Dataset Description

The predictive system uses district-level data containing key sustainability indicators such as:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CO₂ emission level** | Annual carbon output (kilotons) |
| **Average energy consumption** | Household electricity use (kWh per year) |
| **Green area per capita** | m² of accessible public green space |
| **Waste recycling rate** | % of district waste recycled |
| **Population density** | People per km² |
| **Traffic index** | Congestion score (0–100) |
| **DSI (Target variable)** | Expected sustainability score (0–100) |

You may use external datasets such as **Global Urban Indicators**, or simulate your own dataset following these structures — as long as it remains realistic and internally consistent.

## 🧑‍🔬 5. Role of the Data Scientist (Your Role)

As a data scientist at **GCC-SIL**, your responsibilities include:

- Assessing data quality (missing values, duplicates, inaccuracies)  
- Developing derived indicators (e.g., Green Index)  
- Performing statistical and visual analysis  
- Designing ML models that generalize well  
- Evaluating results using MAE, RMSE, and R²  
- Communicating insights to policymakers clearly  

Your predictive model is expected to:

- Be interpretable  
- Demonstrate strong generalization  
- Avoid overfitting  
- Provide actionable insights

## 🚀 6. Importance of the DSI Prediction Model

A reliable sustainability prediction model helps GCC planners:

- Detect districts needing urgent environmental interventions  
- Target investments in green infrastructure  
- Improve public transportation strategies  
- Prioritize waste management upgrades  
- Monitor progress toward sustainability goals  

This system forms a foundation for a future **smart-city sustainability dashboard**.
