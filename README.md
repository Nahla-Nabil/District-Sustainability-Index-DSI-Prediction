# 🌿 District Sustainability Index (DSI) Prediction System

A complete end-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline** for predicting the  
**District Sustainability Index (DSI)** using environmental, demographic, and urban indicators.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project develops a regression-based ML system that predicts the sustainability score (0–100) for urban districts.  
The workflow covers:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory analysis  
- Feature engineering  
- PCA dimensionality reduction  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Visualization & interpretation  

The notebook was developed as part of **TM271 – Machine Learning & Deep Learning** at the **Arab Open University**.
